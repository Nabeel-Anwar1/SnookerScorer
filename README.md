Snooker Scorer!

A mobile application made with React Native where a user can track the score of two players during a snooker match.

I made this application because I was approached by a friend in need who was complaining about writing down using paper and pen and using mental arithmetic to keep track of and find the difference between the scores of the games of snooker he was playing. I did some research and found that there were no apps of the sort on the Play Store that were simple and easy to use. So, I took on the task of creating such an app.

I started by discussing what the app should look like, and I was given a design made on Figma that I should mirror.

I started with the scores initially, I decided to make each "half" of the screen a score for player 1 and player 2.
